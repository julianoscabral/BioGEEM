The code has been written in C++ and compiled with Visual Studio C++ 2010 and 2015. The code integrates beyond the processes presented in the references above: disturbances, climate change, species invasion, temperature feedbacks, habitat degration in lowlands. 

In this repository, you will find one folder with the codes and one folder with the executable and input files ready to play with. 

*Disclaimer* The code and configuration files are not necessarily user friendly (no professional computer scientist here), so please do not hesitate in contacting if you want to apply the model and have trouble figuring out how to specify the configuration file.
